    "In contrast with the Fourier Neural Operator, which has a convolutional architecture, the AFNO leverages contemporary transformer architectures in the computer vision domain. Vision transformers have delivered tremendous success in computer vision. This is primarily due to effective self-attention mechanisms. To cope with this challenge, Guibas et al. proposed <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356601975_Adaptive_Fourier_Neural_Operators_Efficient_Token_Mixers_for_Transformers\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator (AFNO)</a> as an efficient attention mechanism in the Fourier Domain. AFNO is based on the principled foundation of operator learning, which allows us to frame attention as a continuous global convolution efficiently in the Fourier domain. To handle challenges in vision, such as discontinuities in images and high-resolution inputs, AFNO proposes principled architectural modifications to FNO, resulting in memory and computational efficiency. This includes imposing a block-diagonal structure on the channel mixing weights, adaptively sharing weights across tokens, and sparsifying the frequency modes via soft-thresholding and shrinkage. \n",
    "This notebook uses the AFNO transformer for modelling a PDE system. While AFNO has been designed for scaling to extremely high-resolution inputs that the FNO cannot handle as well (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.11214.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">FourCastNet</a>), here we present a simple example using Darcy flow. This problem is intended as an illustrative starting point for data-driven training using AFNO in PhysicsNeMo, but should not be regarded as leveraging the full extent of AFNO's functionality. \n"

    "## Theory of the Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "The Adaptive-Fourier Neural Operator (AFNO) architecture is highly effective and computationally efficient for high-resolution inputs. It combines a key recent advance in modelling PDE systems, namely the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), with the powerful Vision Transformer (ViT) model for image processing. FNO has shown great results in modelling PDE systems such as Navier-Stokes flows. The ViT and related variants of transformer models have achieved SOTA performance in image processing tasks. The multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism of the ViT is key to its impressive performance. The self-attention mechanism models long-range interactions at each layer of the neural network, a feature that is absent in most convolutional neural networks. The drawback of the ViT self-attention architecture is that it scales as a quadratic function of the length of the token sequence and thus scales quadratically with input image resolution. The AFNO provides a solution to the scaling complexity of the ViT. The AFNO model implements a token mixing operation in the Fourier Domain. The computational complexity of the mixing operation is $\\mathcal{O}(N_{token}\\log N_{token})$ as opposed to the $\\mathcal{O}({N_{token}^2})$ complexity of the vanilla ViT architecture.\n",
    "The first step in the architecture involves dividing the input image into a regular grid with $h \\times w$ equal-sized patches of size $p\\times p$. The parameter $p$ is referred to as the patch size. For simplicity, we consider a single-channel image. Each patch is embedded into a token of size $d$, the embedding dimension. The patch embedding operation results in a token tensor ($X_{h\\times w \\times d}$) of size $h \\times w \\times d$. The patch size and embedding dimension are user-selected parameters. A smaller patch size allows the model to capture fine-scale details better while increasing the computational cost of training the model. A higher embedding dimension also increases the parameter count of the model. The token tensor is then processed by multiple layers of the transformer architecture performing spatial and channel mixing. \n",
    "The AFNO architecture implements the following operations in each layer.\n",
    "The token tensor is first transformed to the Fourier domain with\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "z_{m,n} = [\\mathrm{DFT}(X)]_{m,n},\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $m,n$ is the index the patch location and DFT denotes a 2D discrete Fourier transform. The model then applies token weighting in the Fourier domain and promotes sparsity with a Soft-Thresholding and Shrinkage operation as\n",
    "\\begin{equation} \n",
    "\\tilde{z}_{m,n} = S_{\\lambda} ( \\mathrm{MLP}(z_{m,n})),\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $S_{\\lambda}(x) = \\mathrm{sign}(x) \\max(|x| - \\lambda, 0)$ with the sparsity controlling parameter $\\lambda$, and $\\mathrm{MLP(\\cdot)}$ is a 2-layer multi-layer perceptron with block-diagonal weight matrices which are shared across all patches. The number of blocks in the block diagonal MLP weight matrices is a user-selected hyperparameter that should be tuned appropriately. The last operation in an ANFO layer is an inverse Fourier to transform back to the patch domain and add a residual connection as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "y_{m,n} = [\\mathrm{IDFT}(\\tilde{Z})]_{m,n} + X_{m,n}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "At the end of all the transformer layers, a linear decoder converts the feature tensor back to the image space.\n",
    "There are several important hyper-parameters that affect the accuracy and computational cost of the AFNO. Empirically, the most important hyperparameters that should be tuned, keeping in mind the task at hand are the number of layers, patch size, embedding dimension and the number of blocks.\n"
