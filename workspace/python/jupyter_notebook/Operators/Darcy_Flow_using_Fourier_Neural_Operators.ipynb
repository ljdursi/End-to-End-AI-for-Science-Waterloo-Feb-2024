    "Fourier neural operator (FNO) is a data-driven architecture which can be used to parameterize solutions for a distribution of PDE solutions. The key feature of FNO is the spectral convolutions: operations that place the integral kernel in Fourier space. The spectral convolution (Fourier integral operator) is defined as follows:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "(\\mathcal{K}(\\mathbf{w})\\phi)(x) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}(R_{\\mathbf{W}}\\cdot \\left(\\mathcal{F}\\right)\\phi)(x), \\quad \\forall x \\in D\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{F}^{-1}$ are the forward and inverse Fourier transforms, respectively.\n",
    "$R_{\\mathbf{w}}$ is the transformation which contains the learnable parameters $\\mathbf{w}$. Note this operator is calculated\n",
    "over the entire <em>structured Euclidean</em> domain $D$ discretized with $n$ points.\n",
    "Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to perform the Fourier transforms efficiently, and the resulting transformation $R_{\\mathbf{w}}$ is just a finite size matrix of learnable weights. In side the spectral convolution, the Fourier coefficients are truncated to only the lower modes which intern allows explicit control over the dimensionality of the spectral space and linear operator.\n",
    "The FNO model is the composition of a fully-connected \"lifting\" layer, $L$ spectral convolutions with point-wise linear skip connections and a decoding point-wise fully-connected neural network at the end.\n",

    "Similarly $\\mathcal{Q}$ is the point-wise fully-connected decoding network, $\\mathcal{P}: \\mathbb{R}^{k} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d_out}$. Since all fully-connected components of FNO are point-wise operations, the model is invariant to the dimensionality of the input.\n",

Recall that FNO requires a structured Euclidean input such that $D = \\textbf{x}_{i}$ where $i \\in \\mathbb{N}_{N\\times N}$.

Several are shown below, and you can see that the model is able to accurately predict the pressure field for permeability fields it had not seen previously. \n",
