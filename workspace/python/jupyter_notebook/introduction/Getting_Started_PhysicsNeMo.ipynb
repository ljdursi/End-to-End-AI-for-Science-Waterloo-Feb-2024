    "NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo is a deep learning framework that blends the power of physics and partial differential equations (PDEs) with AI to build more robust models for better analysis.\n",
    "There is a plethora of ways in which ML/NN models can be applied for physics-based systems. These can depend based on the availability of observational data and the extent of understanding of underlying physics. Based on these aspects, the ML/NN-based methodologies can be broadly classified into forward (physics-driven), data-driven and hybrid approaches that involve both the physics and data assimilation. PhysicsNeMo aims to provide researchers and industry specialists with various tools to help accelerate the development of such models for the scientific discipline of your need.\n",

    "The building blocks of PhysicsNeMo can be broadly classified into two, which are <strong>Necessary Components</strong> and <strong>Additional Components</strong>, which, as the name suggests, necessary components need to be present in all case setups while additional components aid is analysis, monitoring and improvement of the model.\n",

    "<li><strong>Geometry and Data</strong><ul>\n",
    "<li>PhysicsNeMo provides both physics-informed and data-driven machine-learning solutions for physics simulation problems.  <ul>\n",
    "<li>All these solutions depend on expressing the physics problem as a mathematical optimization problem. The mathematical optimization problem is, in turn, posed on a particular geometry and/or set of data. PhysicsNeMo’ geometry module lets users either build a geometry from scratch using primitives or import an existing geometry from a mesh. </li>\n",
    "<li>For data-driven problems, PhysicsNeMo has multiple methods for accessing data, including standard in-memory datasets as well as lazy loading methods for large-scale datasets.</li>\n",

    "<li>Nodes represent components that will be executed in the forward pass during training. Nodes may contain models or functions such as PyTorch neural networks that are built into PhysicsNeMo, user-defined PyTorch networks, feature transformations, or even equations. A Node may wrap a <code>torch.nn.Module</code> and provides additional information regarding its needed input and output variables. This lets PhysicsNeMo build execution graphs and automatically fill in missing components to compute required derivatives. </li>\n",

Many physical problems need multiple training objectives in order for the problem to be well defined. Constraints provide the means for setting up such problems.</li>\n",

    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><strong>Solver</strong><ul>\n",
    "<li>A Solver is an instance of the core PhysicsNeMo trainer. It implements the optimization loop and manages the training process. A Solver takes a defined Domain and calls the Constraints, Inferencers, Validators, and Monitors when required. During one iteration, the Solver will compute the global loss from all Constraints and then optimize any trainable models present in the Nodes provided to the Constraints.</li>\n",

    "## Physics-Informed approach vs Data-driven approach to neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Physics-informed machine learning and data-driven machine learning are two different approaches to solving problems using machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "<h4 id=\"physics-informed-approach\"><strong>Physics Informed Approach:</strong></h4>\n",
    "Physics-informed machine learning combines principles from physics and machine learning to create more accurate and interpretable models. It involves incorporating known physical laws and equations into the model design to guide the learning process. This approach uses domain-specific knowledge to develop models that are more robust and generalizable. It is particularly useful when the data available for model training is limited, noisy or incomplete. \n",
    "Learning PDEs has many advantages over traditional methods. PINNs (Physics Informed Neural Networks) doesn't require a mesh to compute solutions, making it easier to solve problems on-demand after training. PINNs also allow for analytical gradients, which means they can easily solve both forward and inverse problems using the same optimization process. Not only can PINNs solve differential equations, but they can also solve inverse problems, such as determining fluid flows based on sensor data. The same code used to solve forward problems can be used to solve inverse problems with minimal changes. PINNs can handle PDEs in complex geometries or high dimensions that are difficult to simulate numerically. Overall, PINNs can be used for solving inverse problems and constrained optimization problems, as well as PDEs.\n",
    "<h4 id=\"data-driven-approach\"><strong>Data-driven Approach:</strong></h4>\n",
    "Data-driven machine learning, on the other hand, relies on large amounts of data to develop predictive models. This approach involves using statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in the data and then using these patterns to make predictions or classifications. Data-driven machine learning models are often complex and may not be easily interpretable. They require a large amount of data to achieve high accuracy and are generally less robust than physics-informed models.\n",
    "<h4 id=\"domains-where-physics-informed-approach-would-be-preferred\"><strong>Domains where Physics Informed Approach would be preferred:</strong></h4>\n",
    "Physics-informed approach can be more effective than data-driven approaches in domains where physical laws and constraints play an important role. Some examples include:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><em>Fluid Dynamics</em>: In fluid dynamics, physical laws such as the Navier-Stokes equations describe how fluids behave. PINNs can use these laws to constrain the learning process, making models more accurate and better able to handle complex fluid flow patterns.</li>\n",
    "<li><em>Material Science</em>: In material science, the behaviour of materials is governed by physical laws such as the laws of thermodynamics and elasticity. PIML can be used to develop models that capture the underlying physics, making them more accurate and interpretable.</li>\n",
    "<li><em>Structural Engineering</em>: In structural engineering, physical laws such as the laws of mechanics and materials science govern how structures behave under different conditions. </li>\n",
    "<li><em>Biomedical Engineering</em>: In biomedical engineering, physical laws, such as the laws of fluid mechanics and biomechanics, play a critical role in understanding the behaviour of biological systems.</li>\n",
